<p>Ahn&rsquo;s life has always straddled the  Eastern and Western worlds, and his works express that duality. However, they  share one important quality: a confident mastery of the medium that may seem  especially rare in an artist still in the early stages of his professional  career-rare, that is, until you realize that in his early years, Ahn was a  classic example of a child prodigy.<br>
</p>
<p>In 1979, 2-year-old Jungsuk was  visiting his grandmother in the countryside outside of Daegu, South Korea&rsquo;s  fourth-largest city. One day, the youngster saw some cows in a nearby field. &ldquo;I  came back to my grandmother&rsquo;s house and drew [the scene] exactly as I saw it,&rdquo;  he recalls.<br>
  The boy&rsquo;s talent was vividly  apparent. &ldquo;My grandmother knew how to do traditional Korean ink paintings, and  she tried to teach me,&rdquo; says Ahn.</p>
<p><br>
  Back in Korea, when Jon was 4 years  old, his parents enrolled him in a private art academy aimed at  high-school-level students. &ldquo;At first, the other students just thought I was  cute,&rdquo; says Ahn, hesitating and then adding, &ldquo;until I started doing paintings better  than theirs. But to me the classes were just fun, a plaything.&rdquo;<br>
  </p>
<p>Art playtime quickly turned more  serious when Ahn was 7 [...] with his parents&rsquo; support, Jon began studying  painting privately under the mentorship of Nancy Angell-Rickenbacker, a former  student of Pablo Picasso and Oskar Kokoschka. &ldquo;She was very gentle and  nurturing but had very high expectations and expected exceptional work every  time,&rdquo; Ahn says.</p>
<p><br>
  After high school, in 1996, Ahn  moved across the Atlantic to study art history and computer science at the  American University of Paris. Soon after his arrival, his devotion to painting  took a serious blow with news that Angell-Rickenbacker had died suddenly at the  age of 58. &ldquo;I was so sad,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t do anything art-related for  about two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
  Eventually, his love of art  re-emerged. He began to brush up on his skills by visiting Paris&rsquo; great museums  in his spare time, making personal copies of masterworks by the likes of  Théodore Géricault and Claude Monet. And, he says, &ldquo;Nancy&rsquo;s lessons continued  to stick to me, just like the smell of the dark-roast coffee she always drank.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
  He visited the [Academy of Art  University San Francisco&rsquo;s] spring 2006 student show and was impressed by the  quality of the paintings and drawings he saw; soon after, [signed up]for their  master of fine arts program instead. […] &ldquo;It felt good doing it again,&rdquo; he  says, and suddenly Ahn found himself to be &ldquo;pretty much a full-time artist.&rdquo;  Perhaps because of his decade-long mentorship, however, he didn&rsquo;t follow the  traditional path in his studies under such respected Academy faculty members as  Craig Nelson, Warren Chang, Baoping Chen, Zhaoming Wu, and Tomutsu Takishima.  &ldquo;I was pretty stubborn and confident in my abilities, and they were always  patient with me. Eventually, we would find a middle ground.&rdquo; Since receiving  his MFA degree in May 2010, Ahn has been a member of the Academy&rsquo;s teaching  faculty himself. And the paintings he&rsquo;s been creating since graduating express  a mastery he has now been honing for almost 30 years, from those first classes  back in Korea at the age of 4, through his mentorship under  Angell-Rickenbacker, to his Academy degree.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;There is a narrative quality to the  painting,&rdquo; Ahn explains. &ldquo;But through image, mood, and design, I&rsquo;m trying to  convey personal feeling [...] I&rsquo;m trying to convey basic human emotions,&rdquo; Ahn  concludes, &ldquo;without being overt.&rdquo;</p>
